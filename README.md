### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- Steve
- Analysis of large list of stocks provided by Steve
- Yearly Return: % increase or decrease in price from beginning to end of year
- Total Daily Volume: Trading Volume
- Create a flexible macro for running multiple stocks
- Create a timer to measure the time it takes for the code to execute
- Create a button to push to run the analysis
- Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance
    
### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
- Many subroutines in module, tied multiple macros to the button.
- Rewrote subroutine using starter code to combine all code into one subroutine
- Script ran way faster after refactoring
